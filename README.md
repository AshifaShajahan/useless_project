### Project Description
MedBot is an innovative AI-powered medical conversational assistant designed to provide accurate and informative responses to medical-related queries. This project aims to bridge the gap between medical knowledge and accessibility, providing users
with a user-friendly interface to interact with a medical expert-like assistant.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Medical chatbots are so bored with sensible questions, they're starting to think humans have lost their ability to ask ridiculous, Google-worthy questions.Also because self-diagnosis is the new national pastime.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing "MedBot: The Absurdity Generator"!
<br>MedBot will: <br>
1. Randomly generate nonsensical medical questions.
2. Provide hilariously incorrect answers.
<br>How We'll Solve It : <br>
1. Develop AI-powered "Nonsensical Question Generator" (NQG).
2. Train MedBot with "Trolling Algorithms".
